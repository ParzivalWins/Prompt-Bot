And he hearkened unto their voice, and\\ndid so.\\n26 And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered the\\nSyrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.\\n27 And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went\\nagainst them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little\\nflocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.\\n28 And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said,\\nThus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD [is] God of the\\nhills, but he [is] not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this\\ngreat multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.\\n29 And they pitched one over against the other seven days.

Then [said Ahab], I will send thee away with this\\ncovenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.\\n35 And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the\\nword of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee.

And the king of\\nIsrael said unto him, So [shall] thy judgment [be]; thyself hast decided [it].\\n41 And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel\\ndiscerned him that he [was] of the prophets.\\n42 And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of\\n[thy] hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall\\ngo for his life, and thy people for his people.\\n43 And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to\\nSamaria.', metadata={'source': '../data/kjv.txt'}),\n",
